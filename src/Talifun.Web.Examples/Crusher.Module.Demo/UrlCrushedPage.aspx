            <li>All the css is served from one file that is hosted at a remote location.</li>
            <li>All the js is served from one file that is hosted at a remote location.</li>
            <li>A hash is appended via a querystring to ensure that updates to the files will result in the file being re-served to client.</li>
            <li>Updating any css or js file will result in the crushed file being regenerated and a new hash being created.</li>
            <li>You need to manually copy any newly created local crushed files to the remote location.</li>
            <li>Use the url property to host content on CDN. e.g. "http://cdn.net/1234/site.css" or "http://cdn.net/1234/site.js" the hash is appended to the end of the url, the hash is based off the local crushed file.</li>
            <li>"//cdn.net/1234/site.css" or "//cdn.net/1234/site.js" will use the current pages scheme.</li>
            <li>Specifying fallback condition will allow local content to be loaded when CDN is down for js files.</li>
